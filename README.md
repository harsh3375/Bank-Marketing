# Bank-Marketing
There are two main approaches for companies to promote their products / services: through mass campaigns, which target the general public population, and directed campaign, which targets only a specific group of people. Formal study shows that the efficiency of mass campaign is pretty low. Usually less than 1% of the whole population will have positive response to the mass campaign. In contrast, direct campaign focuses only on a small set of people who are believed to be interested in the product/service being marketed and thus would me much more efficient. Here in our project we focus only on the direct marketing data. Our goal is to predict if a customer will subscribe the service provided by the bank, thereby improving the effect of direct marketing.
